CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTICS

Extra milage


For each vertex h that doesn't belong to V(C) we calculate the extra milage (Allungamento di percorso)
Il costo EM(h, (i,j)) Cih + Chj - Cij 

initialization
Take  2 (better and convinient 3) vertex with as distant as possible and expand by addng the other vetex to the path



GRASP - Gready Randomize Adaptive Search Probabilistic
You must define a probability like 1% or 1/1000 For selecting the vertex.
(So letext the not shortes path with that probability only 1 time out of 100 for example)



META HEURISTICS

Check how many lati are different between T1 and T2 (T1\T2) so the remaning lati are the 
one that are diffent... IF no difference the T1 and T2 are the same
