## Algorithms
- B&C with callbacks
- Advanced topics: SECs for fractional sol.s; posting heuristic sol.s


## Features
- add input flag for cost-itaration function plot + add cplex plot
- Add the fact that if the code use an opt method it must save the image and print the solution with and without the optimization method so it's possible to check both the results || Add multiple solutions on the instance for the final print and images. 


## Documentation
- Make the txt file with the explanation of the homework asked in class && Start preparing the Latex file with the solution proposed
- Comment the code


## Tools (to be used)
- Profiler: Used to check the time that the algorithm takes to complete a certain task.
