## Profiler
Used to check the time that the algorithm takes to complete a certain task.


## Timing
When a new solution is saved (bestSolution() is called) we save the time it took to generate it.

TODO:
 - Save current time when starting the program (in the parser) in inst->tstart
 - Compute current time inside bestSolution() and save the difference with inst->tstart in inst->tbest


## Add bestSolution and optimization to the code

## Use the pointer inside inst as a final bestSolution instead of the one called result (inst->best_sol)

## Add the time limit as input parameter and create the function that stop when the time limit is reached

## Create the parser for the optimization parameter

TODO:
 - Only (2opt) optimization 
 - (2opt) optimization + Tabu search

 Implement this on the algoSelector ???

 ## Update verbose


 ## Make the txt file with the explanation of the homework asked in class


 ## Comment the code

 ## Start preparing the Latex file with the solution proposed

 ## Add the fact that if the code use an opt method it must save the image and print the solution with and without the optimization method so it's possible to check both the results.
